# Paper Reproduction: Simple-Detection-of-AI-Generated-Images-based-on-Noise-Correlation

This repository contains the reproduction of the paper **"Simple Detection of AI-Generated Images based on Noise Correlation"**. The aim is to replicate and implement the techniques presented in the paper for detecting AI-generated images based on noise correlation.

## Training

The training of the model can be found in the file `model.py`. This script contains the code to train the model using the dataset, as described in the paper. You can run the script to train the model and save the resulting weights for inference.

## Inference

For inference, the file `inference.py` is provided. This script allows you to input an image and obtain predictions on whether it is real or generated by an AI, based on the trained model. Simply run the script and follow the instructions to input your image for processing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AndySitc/Simple-Detection-of-AI-Generated-Images-based-on-Noise-Correlation-reproduction.git
    cd Simple-Detection-of-AI-Generated-Images-based-on-Noise-Correlation-reproduction
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. To train the model, run:
    ```bash
    python model.py
    ```

4. To perform inference on an image, run:
    ```bash
    python inference.py
    ```
